### LeetCode-DSA-Problems
This repository contains the solutions in Python language to various data structure and algorithm problems from LeetCode. The solutions are organized by problem number and these are intended to help you prepare for technical interviews and improve your problem-solving skills
Just keep following the sequence of the problems that's coming across day by day.
Before getting to the good approach with less time complexity and space complexity, there are some of the approaches that i come across till i finally get to that optimized code. So, I have kept a record of both the approaches to help you go through all kinds of solutions possible.

You can use the solutions in this repository to:

-> Study and learn different problem-solving techniques.

-> Prepare for technical interviews.

-> Compare your solutions with others.

-> Contribute your own solutions or improvements.

Feel free to explore the directories and use the code as a reference. Make sure to read the problem descriptions on LeetCode for a better understanding of each problem.
